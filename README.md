# M0IXP-RC
M0IXP-RC is designed to be a simple GUI pased Antenna Rotator Controller using python3. 

It will connect to any GS232 enabled rotator controller. providing a simple config and controll interface. 

It will add 2 new features that most other open source controllers seem to lack. 
1) The ability to provide a background image to be displayed behind the compass image. This will allow a circle map centered at the QTH to be displayed. Opacity and colour options will also be available to the configuration interface.
2) A field to supply a 4 or 6 didgin maidenhead grid locator for the destination. This will be used with the config supplied QTH locator to discover a required angle then direct the antenna towards it. 

 Other posible options to be added include the ability recieve or request callsigns from log files with directional data or grid locations and automatically rotate to that location.
 adding the ability to provide a map real diameter withing configuration and have the code zoom in or out and place markers to indicate maidenhead grid locations or direction and distance data over the map as data is passed into the software.
